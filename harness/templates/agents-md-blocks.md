<!-- reins:begin notice v=0.3.0 -->
> The blocks marked `reins:begin … reins:end` are written by reins from `.agents/harness/`. Do not edit them by hand; the user changes them with `reins config` or `reins update` in a terminal. Everything outside the blocks belongs to the project. Nothing in this repository runs reins while you work.

<!-- reins:begin layout v=0.3.0 -->
## Layout

- `.agents/` — committed agent context: `intent/<NNN>_<slug>/{intent,spec}.md`, `audit/<version>.md`, `knowledge/`, `harness/` (settings, roles, templates), `skills/` (the stage skills).
- `.loctx/` — this machine only (gitignored): `ROADMAP.local.md`, `history/<version>.md`, `reports/<version>/`, `context/`, `bindings.local.yaml`.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — the public roadmap.
<!-- reins:end layout -->

<!-- reins:begin settings v=0.3.0 -->
## Settings

- `.agents/harness/bindings.yaml` — the mode (`single` or `multi`), which model does which role group, and `audit.required`. A personal override may sit in `.loctx/bindings.local.yaml`; when it exists, it wins.
- **When `audit.required` is true (the default), every version ends with an audit (skill `audit`). It is mandatory: never skip it; only the user switches it off.**
- `.agents/harness/gates.yaml` — the project's own check commands; the hooks and the `test` skill run them as they are.
- `.agents/harness/roles/<group>.md` — what each role does, must not do, and which tools it may use.

<!-- reins:begin flow v=0.3.0 -->
## Flow

Follow these steps in order; each has a skill in `.agents/skills/`, and each skill names the next.

1. `roadmap` — ideas go to `.loctx/ROADMAP.local.md`; once settled with the user, to `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
2. `intent` — the PM writes the direction and the plan; **the user approves**.
3. `spec` — the spec, its work units (W-n) and checks (V-n); **the user answers 진행 or 수정 on its summary, every time**.
4. `implement` → `review` — one work unit, one commit, naming its spec items.
5. `test` → `merge` → **`audit`** (after the merge, before the rc) → `release` → `retro` (after stable), then delete the version's working files.

The first conversation after installation (or after a reconcile marker appears in this file) starts with `onboard`.

<!-- reins:begin records v=0.3.0 -->
## Approvals and records

- Record an approval by quoting the user in the intent's or spec's `approvals:` — `{ role: user, by, at, words, rev }` — and commit it. Never record an approval the user did not give.
- A step or approval the user tells you to skip goes to the intent's `waivers:` — `{ step, words, at, scope: once }` — at that moment. It applies once; next time, follow the flow.
- Every file you create has an owner and a deletion point (each skill lists them). Working files under `.loctx/reports/<version>/` are summarised in history and the audit, then deleted after the retro.

<!-- reins:begin stops v=0.3.0 -->
## When to stop and ask

- **Ask the user and stop:** an irreversible action (force push, deleting a tag, rewriting the default branch, data or production changes); a stable release; anything that leaves the machine (push, PR, release) unless the settings or the user allow it; scope moving outside the intent and spec; a conflict with a past decision; a next step that needs an approval not yet given.
- **Stop and find the cause:** two failures in the same work unit; empty or doubtful check output; a pass without evidence (a pass needs the raw output's path).
- **When the user interrupts** (chat, Ctrl+C, session end): stop and write the resume point in `.loctx/history/<version>.md`.
- What no role does: `.agents/harness/policy/common-red-lines.yaml`.
